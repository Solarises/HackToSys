**HackToSys** is an open-source, interactive game designed to introduce players to the world of ethical hacking. The game simulates real-world penetration testing (pentesting) scenarios, providing hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting system vulnerabilities. HackToSys serves as an educational platform for aspiring white hat hackers (ethical hackers) and anyone interested in learning about system security in a fun, engaging way.

The primary goal is to equip players with practical knowledge and skills used by penetration testers to legally and responsibly assess and secure systems. The game features multiple missions that increase in difficulty, challenging players to apply various hacking techniques and security strategies.

## Features

- **Realistic Pentesting Simulation**: Players simulate ethical hacking techniques to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities.
- **Terminal-Based Gameplay**: Interact through a terminal interface, executing commands like a real-life pentester.
- **Mission-Based Structure**: Progress through increasingly challenging levels as you develop your hacking skills.
- **Educational Focus**: Learn core ethical hacking concepts, such as vulnerability scanning, network security, and password cracking.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Contribute to the project by reporting issues, suggesting new features, or submitting pull requests.

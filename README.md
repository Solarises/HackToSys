**HackToSys** is an open-source, interactive game designed to introduce players to the world of ethical hacking. The game simulates real-world penetration testing (pentesting) scenarios, providing hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting system vulnerabilities. HackToSys serves as an educational platform for aspiring white hat hackers (ethical hackers) and anyone interested in learning about system security in a fun, engaging way.

The primary goal is to equip players with practical knowledge and skills used by penetration testers to legally and responsibly assess and secure systems. The game features multiple missions that increase in difficulty, challenging players to apply various hacking techniques and security strategies.
